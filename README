Notes for elisp target:

* See antlr revision 3922. We're skipping unique ids for tree nodes. Need to go back and figure out why these are necessary. 

* antlr rev 3994. 
  Skipping shared recognizer state changes. 
  Skipping tree adaptor impl changes -- we just don't need it.

* at lexerRule in ELisp.stg -- assignment from _channel was overrwriting our lexer action..
